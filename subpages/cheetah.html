      <h1>How can a Cheetah run so fast?</h1>
      <div class="div">

          One of these felines’ most prominent characteristics is their light
          bodyweight, which helps them gaining speed faster. On top of that,
          they have small heads and long legs for getting the best out of
          aerodynamics’ law. Also, their flexible spine allows for extreme
          extension during the run. Being able to flex as much as cheetahs do,
          help them rotate their hips and scapula in a way that incentivizes
          speed.

          Huge leg muscles that expand faster to produce faster speeds.

        <article class="article-right">
          Keep in mind that cheetahs’ anatomy is all set for sprinting. These
          felines can sustain high speeds for short bursts, but they take up to
          30 minutes to fully recover after having chased their prey.
          Additionally, being built for speed comes with some drawbacks. For
          example, cheetahs are not as strong and aggressive as other predators
          in the savannah, such as lions or leopards. For this reason, cheetahs
          tend to flight instead of fight.
