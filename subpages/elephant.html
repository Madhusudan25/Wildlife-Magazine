      <h1>Differences between African and Asian Elephants</h1>
      <img src="images/elephant.jpg" alt="Elephants" />
      <article>
        <header>1. Head shape</header>
        <p>
          African elephants have fuller, more rounded heads, and the top of
          their head is a single dome shape. Asian elephants have a twin-domed
          head with an indent running up the center of their head.
        </p>

      <article>
        <header>2. Size & shape of ears</header>
        <p>
          African elephants have much larger ears, shaped a little like the
          continent of Africa. Asian elephant’s ears are smaller, and more
          semi-circular. Both elephant species use their ears to dissipate body
          heat, and as African elephants live in hotter climates with more
          direct sunlight than Asian elephants they need to dissipate more heat.
          Hence the larger ears.
        </p>

      <article>
        <header>3. Size & weight</header>
        <p>
          The African elephant is the larger of the two elephants, with bulls
          growing up to 4 meters tall. By contrast, the biggest Asian males
          reach no more than 3.5 meters. One interesting note on elephant height
          – the African elephant is tallest at the shoulder, while the Asian
          elephant’s tallest point is its back.

      <article>
        <header>4. Appearance & size of tusks</header>
        <p>
          Not all elephants have tusks. Both male and female African elephants
          can have tusks, but only male Asian elephants have tusks. Female Asian
          elephants have rudimentary tusks called tushes, which can be also
          found in some males.

        <header>5. The Trunk</header>
        <p>
          An African elephant’s trunk has more visible rings on it, and is not
          as hard to the touch as the Asian elephant trunk. The end of their
          trunks are also very different – the African elephant trunk has two
          distinct ‘fingers’ which they use to pick up and manipulate objects.
          The Asian elephant has only one ‘finger’ at the end of its trunk,
          which they compensate for by holding objects against the underside of
          their trunk.
        </p>

      <article>
        <header>6. Lower lip shape</header>
        <p>
          The lower lips of the two elephants differ, though you can only really
          notice this one if you’re close up and the elephant has a raised trunk
          and open mouth… something of an intimidating position to be in!
        </p>
      </article>

      <article>
        <header>7. Skin texture</header>
        <p>
          The African elephants’ skin is more wrinkled than the Asian elephants’
          smoother skin.
        </p>

      <article>
        <header>8. Number of toenails</header>
        <p>
          The number of toenails varies between the African bush elephant,
          African forest elephant, and Asian elephant:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>African forest elephants:</span> 5 toenails on the front feet
          and 4 on the back feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Asian elephants:</span> 5 toenails on the front feet and 4 on
          the back feet.
