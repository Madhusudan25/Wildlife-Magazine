      <h1>Six Rarest Tiger Species In The World</h1>

        <p>
          <b>Current Estimated Population:</b> functionally extinct in the wild,
          but about 100 or so in captivity
        </p>
        <p><b>Location:</b> Southeast China – mostly in Hainan Moist Forests</p>
        <p><b>Current Conservation Status:</b> Critically Endangered</p>
        <p><b>Scientific Name:</b> Panthera tigris amoyensis</p>

        <div>
          The South China Tiger has been declared “functionally extinct” in the
          wild by scientists, which makes it the rarest tiger species in the
          world. While the South China Tiger has not been seen in the wild for
          more than 25 years, there are about 100 tigers in captivity and
          breeding programs have been ongoing.
          <div>
            <div class="did-you-know">Did You Know?</div>
            The skull of the South China Tiger is different from all other
            surviving tiger species. Because of this, the South China Tiger is
            considered to be the original tiger from which all other current
            tiger subspecies evolved.

        <p><b>Current Estimated Population:</b> 250 to 340</p>
        <p>
          <b>Location:</b> Southern and central parts of the Malay Peninsula;
          southern tip of Thailand
        </p>
        <p><b>Current Conservation Status:</b> Critically Endangered</p>
        <p><b>Scientific Name:</b> Panthera tigris jacksoni</p>

        <div>
          Until 2004, the Malayan Tiger was classified as the same species as
          the Indochina Tiger. However, following a genetic analysis, it was
          determined that the Malayan Tiger was its own subspecies and it was
          dubbed the Panthera tigris jacksoni, in honor of Peter Jackson, a
          famed tiger conservationists.
          <div>
            <div class="did-you-know">Did You Know?</div>
            In the Malay language, the Malayan Tiger is called harimau, often
            shortened to just rimau.

        <div>
          The Indochinese Tiger is native to Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam,
          Cambodia, and southwestern China. However, scientists believe that the
          Indochinese Tiger may be extinct in China as no individuals have been
          seen in the area in recent years.
          <div>
            <div class="did-you-know">Did You Know?</div>
            The Indochinese Tiger’s scientific name, Panthera tigris corbetti,
            pays homage to Jim Corbett, a British hunter who took down
            man-eating tigers and leopards in India, but later became a
            conservationist

          The Sumatarn Tiger is the last remaining tiger supspecies in the
          Sundra Islands of Indonesia, which used to also be home the Bali and
          Javan Tigers – the Bali Tiger went extinct in the 1950s, while the
          Javan Tiger was last seen in the 1980s. Sources differ, but it is
          estimated that there are between 400 to 600 Sumatran Tigers left in
          the wild.
          <div>
            <div class="did-you-know">Did You Know?</div>
            The Sumatran Tiger is the smallest subspecies of tiger, and also has
            the darkest fur (very dark orange) and the highest density of
            stripes compared to the other tigers.

        <p><b>Current Estimated Population:</b> 500 to 600</p>
        <p>
          <b>Location:</b> Russian Far East; Northeast China; and possibly North

        <div>
          The Siberian or Amur Tiger is primarily found in the dense forests of
          the Russian Far East, but also lives in parts of Northeast China and
          possibly North Korea. In the past, the Siberian Tiger’s range was much
          larger and could be found throughout the Korean Peninsula, north
          China, and Mongolia in addition to the Russian Far East.
          <div>
            <div class="did-you-know">Did You Know?</div>
            In captivity, the Siberian Tiger is the largest of all the remaining
            tiger subspecies, growing as large as 660 pounds (300 kilograms) and
            10.75 feet (3.28 meters) long. However, in the wild, the Bengal
            Tiger is bigger.

        <header>6.Bengal Tiger</header>
        <img src="images/Bengal-Tiger.jpg" alt="Bengal Tiger" />

        <p><b>Current Estimated Population:</b> 2,603–3,346</p>
        <p>
          <b>Location:</b> Indian Subcontinent (Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan)

          When people think about tigers, they’re most likely picturing the
          Bengal Tiger, which is not only has the most populous tiger
          subspecies, but also represents all tigers. As the tiger subspecies
          with the highest numbers, Bengal Tigers are found at zoos and wildlife
          parks around the world, and even live shows in Las Vegas. If you’ve
          ever seen a tiger in person, it was most likely a Bengal Tiger.
          <div>
            <div class="did-you-know">Did You Know?</div>
            The reason for the high number (compared to the other tiger
            subspecies) of Bengal Tigers is that they have been captive bred
            since 1880 and are widely crossbred with other tiger subspecies.
