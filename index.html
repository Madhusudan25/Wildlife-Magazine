            Tigers are some of the coolest and most recognizable animals in the
            world.They’re staples at zoos around the world and have fascinated
            humans for centuries. However, despite the adoration, tigers are one
            of the most threatened species in the world. Tiger numbers have
            continually been in decline for decades and there are less than
            4,000 tigers remaining in the wild.

            Earth's Largest Living Land-Animals. Elephants are the largest land
            animals on Earth, and they're one of the most unique-looking
            animals, too. With their characteristic long noses, or trunks;
            large, floppy ears; and wide, thick legs, there is no other animal
            with a similar physique.

          <p>
            The cheetah is the world's fastest land mammal. With acceleration
            that would leave most automobiles in the dust, a cheetah can go from
            0 to 60 miles an hour in only three seconds. These big cats are
            quite nimble at high speed and can make quick and sudden turns in
            pursuit of prey.

        <header>The Silent Flight of Owls, Explained</header>
        <div id="section2_division1">
          “Owls have a suite of unique wing and feather features that enable
          them to reduce locomotion-induced sound,” says Krista Le Piane, a
          graduate student at the University of California.
        </div>
        <div id="section2_division2">
          <p id="section2_paragraph1">
            They have large wings relative to their body mass, which let them
            fly unusually slowly—as slowly as two mph for a large species like
            the Barn Owl—by gliding noiselessly with little flapping.
            Additionally, the structure of their feathers serves as a silencer.
            Comb-like serrations on the leading edge of wing feathers break up
            the turbulent air that typically creates a swooshing sound. Those
            smaller streams of air are further dampened by a velvety texture
            unique to owl feathers and by a soft fringe on a wing's trailing
            edge. These structures together streamline the air flow and absorb
            the sound produced.
          </p>

          <p id="section2_paragraph2">
            The sound-dampening structures didn't evolve by chance. Silent
            flight is clearly crucial for many owls' survival, and two long-held
            hypotheses attempt to explain this ability. The "stealthy hunting
            hypothesis" holds that owls fly inaudibly so that prey can’t hear
            them coming and have less time to escape.

        <header>Are we afraid of Sharks?</header>
        <div id="section3_division1">
          “Shark bites are strongly correlated to the number of people and
          number of sharks in the water at the same time,” says Gavin Naylor,
          director of the Florida Program for Shark Research, which maintains
          the International Shark Attack File.
        </div>
        <div id="section3_division2">
          <p id="section3_paragraph1">
            Recent research indicates that shark attacks in some parts of the
            world appear to be on the rise. The eastern US and southern
            Australia have seen shark attack rates almost double in the past 20
            years, while Hawaii has also seen a sharp increase. But why?
          </p>

          <p id="section3_paragraph2">
            But there is no real evidence that sharks are actively hunting
            humans, according to the scientists who study them.The findings
            highlight one of the key challenges in understanding why sharks bite
            humans. There are dozens of different species responsible for bites,
            each with their own unique behaviour, hunting strategies, prey and
            preferred habitat – although in many cases the species can be
            misidentified or not identified at all. The majority of unprovoked
            attacks on humans where a species is identified involve three large
            culprits: the great white, tiger and bull sharks.
